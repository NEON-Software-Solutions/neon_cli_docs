# NEON CLI

Developed with ðŸ’™ by NEON Software Solutions

---

A CLI for developers who give Vollgas.

## Install

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Due to our complete revamp: If you have an older version of the CLI installed (you started working here before 2024 and when you type in NEON in your terminal, something happens), then you'll have to deactivate it first: ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

```sh
onepub pub global deactivate neon_cli
```

Installing then works with another one-liner:

```sh
onepub pub global activate neon_cli
```

## Commands

### `NEON abfahrt`

Creates a new project based on the templates inside the [NEON App Library][neon_app_library_link].

### `NEON update`

Updates the CLI. Or tells you to chill if there is no update.

### `NEON --help`

For the helpless among us.

### A little overview

```sh
A CLI built for flutter devs who give Vollgas.

Usage: NEON <command> [arguments]

Global options:
-h, --help       Print this usage information.
    --version    The current version of the CLI

Available commands:
  abfahrt   NEON abfahrt <project-name>
            Creates a new project in the current directory
  update    NEON update
            Updates the NEON CLI

Run "NEON help <command>" for more information about a command.
```

## Usage

```sh
# Create a new app called awesome_app:
NEON abfahrt awesome_app
```

### Maintenance

Should you ever be part of the exclusive circle that pushes updates for the CLI, do not forget to update the version number inside the `pubspec.yaml` and to run `dart run build_runner build` afterwards. Then create a new PR from a feature branch and kick off the review process!

### Watch out!

Please update the [docs][cli_docs_repo_link] as well, everytime you update the CLI!
