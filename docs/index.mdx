# NEON CLI

Developed with 💙 by NEON Software Solutions

---

A CLI for developers who give Vollgas.

## Installieren

🚨🚨🚨 If you have an older version of the CLI installed (when you type in NEON in your terminal, something happens), then you'll have to deactivate it first: 🚨🚨🚨

```sh
onepub pub global deactivate neon_cli
```

Installing then works with another one-linler:

```sh
onepub pub global activate neon_cli
```

## Commands

### `NEON abfahrt`

Creates a new project based on the templates inside the [NEON App Library][neon_app_library_link] definierten Templates.

### `NEON --help`

For the helpless among us.

### A little overview

```sh
A CLI built for flutter devs who give Vollgas.

Usage: NEON <command> [arguments]

Global options:
-h, --help       Print this usage information.
    --version    The current version of the CLI

Available commands:
  abfahrt   NEON abfahrt <project-name>
            Creates a new project in the current directory

Run "NEON help <command>" for more information about a command.
```

## Usage

```sh
# Create a new app called awesome_app:
NEON abfahrt awesome_app
```

### Maintenance

Should you ever be part of the exclusive circle that pushes updates for the CLI, do not forget to update the version number inside the `pubspec.yaml` and to run `dart run build_runner build` afterwards. Then create a new PR from a feature branch and kick off the review process!

#### How to add a new app template to the CLI

### Watch out!

Please update the [docs][cli_docs_repo_link] as well, everytime you update the CLI!
